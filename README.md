## A 'modern' 236 website
This is the website for First Robotics Team 236 'TechnoTicks.'\
Proudly using no plug-ins and junk in the back end (- 'tick toc'); just pure, sweet, HTML and minimal CSS.\
Code by Woody, Mike, and GitHub user ko-sako "Kayo Osako"\
\
Be careful when touching the code; MY CODE IS BAD AND WILL BREAK.\
Thanks,\
Woody (self-proclaimed head website coder)
