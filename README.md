## A 'modern' 236 website
This is the website for First Robotics Team 236 'TechnoTicks.'\
~~Proudly using no plug-ins and junk in the back end (- 'tick toc'); just pure, sweet, HTML and minimal CSS.~~\
Originally designed completely in HTML and then enhanced with some vibe coding done with AI.\
Code by Woody, Mike, and GitHub user ko-sako "Kayo Osako";\
Thanks to Deepsite AI Model for code help;\
In addtion some code was made using help from Deepseek AI\
\
Be careful when touching the code; MY CODE IS BAD AND WILL BREAK.\
Thanks,\
Woody (self-proclaimed head website coder)
